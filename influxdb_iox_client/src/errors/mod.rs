//! Error types returned by the [`Client`][crate::Client].
//!
//! A request to an IOx server can fail in three main ways:
//!
//!  - a HTTP transport error (network error)
//!  - a known API handler error response
//!  - an unknown error returned by the server
//!
//! The first is converted into a [`HttpError`] and contains details of the
//! failed request.
//!
//! The second case is when the "business logic" of the API handler returns a
//! defined, meaningful error to the client. Examples of this include "the
//! database name is invalid" or "the database already exists". These are mapped
//! to per-handler error types (see [`CreateDatabaseError`] as an example).
//!
//! The last case is a generic error returned by the IOx server. These become
//! [`ServerErrorResponse`] instances and contain the error string, optional
//! error code and HTTP status code sent by the server.
