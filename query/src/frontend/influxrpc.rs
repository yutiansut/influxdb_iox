/// Plans queries that originate from the InfluxDB Storage gRPC
/// interface, which are in terms of the InfluxDB Data model (e.g.
/// `ParsedLine`). The query methods on this trait such as
/// `tag_columns` are specific to this data model.
///
/// The IOx storage engine implements this trait to provide Timeseries
/// specific queries, but also provides more generic access to the
/// same underlying data via other frontends (e.g. SQL).
///
/// The InfluxDB data model can can be thought of as a relational
/// database table where each column has both a type as well as one of
/// the following categories:
///
/// * Tag (always String type)
/// * Field (Float64, Int64, UInt64, String, or Bool)
/// * Time (Int64)
///
/// While the underlying storage is the same for columns in different
/// categories with the same data type, columns of different
/// categories are treated differently in the different query types.
