# Rationale and Goals
As every Rust programmer knows, the language has many powerful features, and there are often several patterns which can express the same idea. Also, as every professional programmer comes to discover, code is almost always read far more than it is written.

Thus, we choose to use a consistent set of idioms throughout our code so that it is easier to read and understand for both existing and new contributors.


## Unsafe and Platform-Dependent conditional compilation

### Avoid `unsafe` Rust

One of the main reasons to use Rust as an implementation language is
its strong memory safety guarantees; Almost all of these guarantees
are voided by the use of `unsafe`. Thus, unless there is an excellent
reason and the use is discussed beforehand, it is unlikely IOx will
accept patches with `unsafe` code.

We may consider taking unsafe code given:

1. performance benchmarks showing a *very* compelling improvement
2. a compelling explanation of why the same performance can not be achieved using `safe` code
2. tests showing how it works safely across threads

### Avoid platform specific conditional compilation `cfg`

We hope that IOx is usable across many different platforms and
Operating systems, which means we put a high value on standard Rust.

While some performance critical code may require architecture specific
instructions, (e.g. `AVX512`) most of the code should not.


## Errors

### All errors should follow the [SNAFU crate philosophy](https://docs.rs/snafu/0.6.8/snafu/guide/philosophy/index.html) and use SNAFU functionality

*Good*:

* Derives `Snafu` and `Debug` functionality
* Has a useful, end-user-friendly display message

```rust
#[derive(Snafu, Debug)]
pub enum Error {
    #[snafu(display(r#"Conversion needs at least one line of data"#))]
    NeedsAtLeastOneLine,
    // ...
}
```

*Bad*:
```rust
pub enum Error {
    NeedsAtLeastOneLine,
    // ...
```



### Use the `ensure!` macro to check a condition and return an error

*Good*:

* Reads more like an `assert!`
* Is more concise
```rust
ensure!(!self.schema_sample.is_empty(), NeedsAtLeastOneLine);
```

*Bad*
```rust
if self.schema_sample.is_empty() {
    return Err(Error::NeedsAtLeastOneLine {});
}
```


### Errors should be defined in the module they are instantiated



*Good*:

* Groups related error conditions together most closely with the code that produces them
* Reduces the need to `match` on unrelated errors that would never happen

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Snafu)]
pub enum Error {
    #[snafu(display("Not implemented: {}", operation_name))]
    NotImplemented { operation_name: String }
}
// ...
ensure!(foo.is_implemented(), NotImplemented {
    operation_name: "foo",
}
```

*Bad*
```rust
use crate::errors::NotImplemented;
// ...
ensure!(foo.is_implemented(), NotImplemented {
    operation_name: "foo",
}
```

### The `Result` type alias should be defined in each module

*Good*:

* Reduces repetition
```
pub type Result<T, E = Error> = std::result::Result<T, E>;
...
fn foo() -> Result<bool> { true }
```

*Bad*
```
...
fn foo() -> Result<bool, Error> { true }
```



### `Err` variants should be returned with `fail()`

*Good*
```rust
return NotImplemented {
    operation_name: "Parquet format conversion",
}.fail();
```

*Bad*
```rust
return Err(Error::NotImplemented {
    operation_name: String::from("Parquet format conversion"),
});
```


### Use `context` to wrap underlying errors into module specific errors

*Good*:

* Reduces boilerplate

```rust
input_reader
    .read_to_string(&mut buf)
    .context(UnableToReadInput {
        input_filename,
    })?;
```

*Bad*

```rust
input_reader
    .read_to_string(&mut buf)
    .map_err(|e| Error::UnableToReadInput {
        name: String::from(input_filename),
        source: e,
    })?;
```

*Hint for `Box<dyn::std::error::Error>` in Snafu*:

If your error contains a trait object (e.g. `Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>`), in order to use  `context()` you need to wrap the error in a `Box` :

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Snafu)]
pub enum Error {

    #[snafu(display("gRPC planner got error listing partition keys: {}", source))]
    ListingPartitions {
        source: Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>,
    },
}

...

  // Wrap error in a box prior to calling context()
database
  .partition_keys()
  .await
  .map_err(|e| Box::new(e) as _)
  .context(ListingPartitions)?;

```

Note the `as _` in the `map_err` call. Without it, you may get an error such as:

```
error[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `<ListingPartitions as IntoError<influxrpc::Error>>::Source == Box<<D as Database>::Error>`
  --> query/src/frontend/influxrpc.rs:63:14
   |
63 |             .context(ListingPartitions)?;
   |              ^^^^^^^ expected trait object `dyn snafu::Error`, found associated type
   |
   = note: expected struct `Box<(dyn snafu::Error + Send + Sync + 'static)>`
              found struct `Box<<D as Database>::Error>`
   = help: consider constraining the associated type `<D as Database>::Error` to `(dyn snafu::Error + Send + Sync + 'static)`
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html
```


### Each error cause in a module should have a distinct Error enum

Specific error types are preferred over a generic error with a `message` or `kind` field.

*Good*:

- Makes it easier to track down the offending code based on a specific failure
- Reduces the size of the error enum (`String` is 3x 64-bit vs no space)
- Makes it easier to remove vestigial errors
- Is more concise

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Snafu)]
pub enum Error {
    #[snafu(display("Error writing remaining lines {}", source))]
    UnableToWriteGoodLines { source: IngestError },

    #[snafu(display("Error while closing the table writer {}", source))]
    UnableToCloseTableWriter { source: IngestError },
}

// ...

write_lines.context(UnableToWriteGoodLines)?;
close_writer.context(UnableToCloseTableWriter))?;
```


*Bad*

```rust
pub enum Error {
    #[snafu(display("Error {}: {}", message, source))]
    WritingError {
        source: IngestError ,
        message: String,
    },
}

write_lines.context(WritingError {
    message: String::from("Error while writing remaining lines"),
})?;
close_writer.context(WritingError {
    message: String::from("Error while closing the table writer"),
})?;
```
